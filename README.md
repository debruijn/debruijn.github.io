# Personal website
This is the repository for me personal website. This is a website to be launched in the future (hopefully soon?) and
it will contain a blog, my portfolio and potentially more.

This repository shows the backend setup, for which I use Zola and the Tale-Zola theme. You might find some future plans
in here - but no promises that the resulting blogs will actually be written! :)

I plan on using Github features like Issues for getting feedback (future blog post topics, suggestions, etc). So feel
free to start using them! (Although perhaps not worth it until I actually launch the website?)
