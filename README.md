# Personal website
This is the repository for my personal website, containing a blog and a portfolio. And who knows what else I might be
using it for in the future?

This repository shows the backend setup, for which I use Zola and the serene theme. You might find some future plans
in here as well - but no promises that those half-planned blogs will actually be written or
finished! :)

I plan on using Github features like Issues for getting feedback (future blog post topics, suggestions, etc). So feel
free to start using them!
