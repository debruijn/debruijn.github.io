# Welcome, welkom, bon bini, bienvenido ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bert and I am a data scientist and econometrician from the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± currently living on Bonaire ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¶ in the
Caribbean Netherlands. On this website you can find my [blog](posts) and [portfolio](portfolio), and what else I 
want to put here in the future.

## Requests and reactions

If you have a request for a topic, such as a follow-up to an existing one, feel free to open an issue on this websites'
[Github](https://github.com/debruijn/personal_website). For now, you can leave comments there as well. I might include
a commenting system on the website itself in the future but that is not part of my current plans.

If you have other ways of reaching me, you can use those as well of course. :)

## Technical details

This website has been built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) using the 
[serene](https://github.com/isunjn/serene) theme. Have a look at technical details 
[here](https://github.com/debruijn/debruijn.github.io).
