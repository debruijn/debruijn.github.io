This is my website, built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) using the 
[Tala-Zola](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola) theme.

The goal of this website is to have a location for interesting experiments and thoughts that I want to share with the
world, as well as a place to present my portfolio. In the future I might also have other ideas, who knows?

## Requests and reactions

If you have a request for a topic, such as a follow-up to an existing one, feel free to open an issue on this websites'
[Github](https://github.com/debruijn/personal-website). For now, you can leave comments there as well. I might include
a commenting system on the website itself in the future but that is not part of my current plans.

If you have other ways of reaching me, you can use those as well of course... 

## And one more thing..

Thanks for being here! Have a great day!
